This is Ellipsis,
my new piece of blogging software.

Before Ellipsis,
I've developed another blogging platform called Expressive for a job interview,
but ended up using it and maintaining it for quite some time after that.

Expressive uses MongoDB as a database and has a web form for posting new stuff.
I got tired of that and decided to create something new,
using the file system and Git as a database system,
in true Unix fashion.
That would be Ellipsis.
